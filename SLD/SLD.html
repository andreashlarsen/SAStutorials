<h4>Before you start</h4>
<p>
<ul>
 	<li>It is a good idea to have SasView installed for this tutorial. You can download it from <a href="https://www.sasview.org/", target="_blank">sasview.org</a>. </li>
	<li>You will need to make calculations by hand. A spreadsheet and possibly pen and paper are recommended.</li>	
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Learning Outcomes</h4>
After completing this tutorial you will
<ul>
	<li>Understand the difference between scattering length densities for X-rays and neutrons.</li>
	<li>Be able to calculate scattering length densities for both X-rays and neutrons.</li>
	<li>Be able to calculate percentages of D$_2$O and H$_2$O to match out certain parts of a sample.</li>
	<li>Decide on SANS/SAXS and solvent based on your specific sample.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Introduction</h4>
	<p>
		Scattering length density (SLD) is a measure of a material's ability to scatter. SLD varies greatly depending on whether X-rays (SAXS) or neutrons (SANS) are used.
		This is because X-rays scatter from the electrons of a material, while neutrons scatter from the nuclei. In general, the SLD of a material can be calculated as:
		$$
			\text{SLD} = \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^n b_i}{V},
		$$
		where $b_i$ is the (coherent) scattering length of atom $i$, and $V$ is the molecular volume of the material in question. For X-rays, the scattering length of an atom is roughly proportional to the atomic number $Z$ of that atom.
		However, for neutrons, the scattering lengths of atoms vary irregularly throughout the periodic table. This is illustrated in the figure below.<br><br>

		<img src="SLDXN2.png" style="width:800px"/>
		<br>
		<em>Comparison of coherent scattering cross sections (square of the coherents scattering lenghts) for neutrons (red) and X-rays (blue).</em>
		<br><br>

		For neutrons, it is common to list the scattering length of an atom in units of fm (femtometers, $10^{-15}$ m). The X-ray scattering length of an atom is essentially given by $b=Zr_e$, where $r_e = 2.82$ fm is the classical electron radius.
		<!-- This approximation holds because SAXS uses hard X-rays ($E>10 \text{ keV}$) with wavelengths dissimilar from those often absorbed by atoms in soft matter. <br><br> -->
	</p>

<h4>Part I: Calculate SLD's</h4>
In this exercise we will calculate the scattering length densities for the two most commonly used solvents in SAS experiments, H$_2$O and D$_2$O for both X-rays and neutrons.

		<ul style="border-width:3px; border-style:solid;border-color:#697698; padding: 1em; padding-left: 40px; background-color: #f9f9f9"> 
			<b>Exercise: Calculate scattering length densities.</b>
			
			<li>Calculate the volume of H$_2$O and D$_2$O from the density and molecular weight. They can be found on wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water", target="_blank">water</a> 
			and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_water", target="_blank">heavy water</a> </li>
			<li>Calculate the scattering lengths for X-rays using $b=Zr_e$.</li>
			<li>For neutrons, use <a href="https://www.ncnr.nist.gov/resources/n-lengths/", target="_blank"> this database from NIST</a> to find the coherent scattering length (Click the relevant elements and use the column "Coh b"). Note that deuterium is 2H.</li>	
			<li>Calculate the $\text{SLD}$ for both X-rays and neutrons using the formula above.</li>
			<li>Fill out the table below and give your answers in $10^{-6} \text{ Å}^{-2}$.</li>

		</ul>

		In practice, one can also use a SLD Calculator. In SasView, the SLD Calculator can be found under "Tools". Alternatively one can use <a href="https://www.ncnr.nist.gov/resources/activation/", target="_blank">an online calculator from NIST.</a><br><br>

		Many SAS experiments are performed on samples consisting of particles dissolved in a solvent. If the SLD of the sample is similar to the solvent's SLD,
		the scattering from the sample will be weak. This difference or the <i>excess scattering length density</i> is defined as
		$$
			\Delta \text{SLD} = \text{SLD}_{\text{sample}} - \text{SLD}_{\text{solvent}}
		$$
		The intensity of scattering from the sample is proportional to $\Delta \text{SLD}^2$, which we call <i>contrast</i>. <br><br>

		<h4>Part II: Contrast matching</h4>
		Sometimes, we want to match the SLD of the sample to the solvent, to make the sample or a part of the sample <i>invisible</i>.
		This technique is called <i>contrast variation</i>. In the exercise below, you will learn how to match out a protein.<br><br>

		<ul style="border-width:3px; border-style:solid;border-color:#697698; padding: 1em; padding-left: 40px; background-color: #f9f9f9"> 
			<b>Exercise: Match out a protein in SANS</b>
			<li>Since there is only a difference in SLD between H$_2$O and D$_2$O for neutrons, this exercise only relates to SANS.</li>
			<li>Assume that the SLD of a protein is $1.3 \times 10^{-6} \text{ Å}^{-2}$.</li>
			<li>Calculate the fraction of H$_2$O and D$_2$O in your solvent in order to match out the protein ($\Delta \text{SLD}=0$). You can use the numbers you calculated in the previous exercise</li>

				<span class="link-text" onclick="document.getElementById('hiddenText').style.display='block'">
					Display hint
				</span>
			
				<p id="hiddenText">To do this, you have to isolate x in the following equation
					\begin{equation}
						\Delta \text{SLD} =\text{SLD}_{\text{protein}} - x \times \text{SLD}_{\text{H}_2\text{O}} - (1-x) \times \text{SLD}_{\text{D}_2\text{O}} = 0,
					\end{equation}
					where $x$ is the fraction of H$_2$O in the solvent.

<h4>Part III: Sodium dodecyl sulfate</h4>
	<p>
		This section focuses on the detergent <i>sodium dodecyl sulfate</i> (SDS), CH$_3$(CH)$_2$OSO$_3$Na, which is used to solubilize membrane proteins.
		As a first exercise, calculate the SLD of SDS for both X-rays and neutrons with <a href="https://www.ncnr.nist.gov/resources/activation/", target="_blank">the online calculator from NIST</a>.
		For this you only need the molecular formula of SDS and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_dodecyl_sulfate", target="_blank">the density which can be found on wikipedia</a>. 
		For the X-ray source, assume an energy of 10 keV. You should see a table like the one below. <br><br>

		<img src="NISTCalculationSDS.png" style="width:800px"/><br><br>

		Under "Scattering length density" is the SLD for neutrons as "real". The SLD for X-rays is given as "X-ray SLD" under "real". Both marked in red.<br><br>

		Next, determine the percentage of H$_2$O and D$_2$O in your solvent in order to match out SDS in a SANS experiment. This is the contrast match point, and is given below the table in the <a href="https://www.ncnr.nist.gov/resources/activation/", target="_blank">NIST SLD calculater</a><br><br>

		In reality, the SLD of SDS varies between the hydrophilic head group and the hydrophibic tail group. In addition to this, SDS forms micelles in solution with 
		aggregation number $N\sim66$. In the exercise below, we calculate the forward scattering ($I(q=0)$) of SDS micelles, which is given by

		\begin{equation}
			I(q=0) = n N^2 \left( \Delta \mathrm{SLD}_\mathrm{tail} V_\mathrm{tail} +  \Delta \mathrm{SLD}_\mathrm{head} V_\mathrm{head}\right)^2,
		\end{equation}

		where $n$ is the number density of the micelles.

			<b>Exercise: Calculate SLD and forward scattering of SDS</b>
			<li>In the image below the head/tail structure of the SDS molecule can be seen,
				as well as some SAXS data with a SDS concentration of 5 mg/mL. </li>
			<li>Calculate the SLD for the headgroup (SO$_4$Na, $V=60.5 \text{ Å}^3$), and tailgroup (C$_{12}$H$_{25}$, $V=355 \text{ Å}^3$) for X-rays.</li>
			<li>Calculate the number density $n$ of micelles. (Start by calculating the concentration in $\text{mol/cm}^3$).</li>
			<li>Finally, calculate the forward scattering</li>
			<li>How does it compare to the data?</li>

	In some applications, it can be useful to <i>deuterate</i> the detergents. This is done by replacing the hydrogen in the detergent with deuterium.
	Read more about this technique in the <a href="https://sastutorials.org/InvisibleDetergents/InvisibleDetergents.html", target="_blank">Tutorial on invisible detergents</a>.

<h4>Part IV: Designing a neutron scattering experiment</h4>
<p>
	In this part, we will design a SANS experiment to study the size and polydispersity of SiO$_2$ nanoparticles.
	Additionally, a cationic surfactant (CetylTrimethylAmmonium Bromide - CTAB) is added to the solution in a concentration 
	close to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_micelle_concentration" target="_blank">critical micelle concentration</a> (CMC). The added CTAB is expected to form micelles around the nanoparticles with a thickness 2-3 nm.
	The added CTAB prohibits aggregation of SiO$_2$ nanoparticles.
	For our experiment we wish to gain information on both the SiO$_2$ nanoparticles and the CTAB coating. First we would like to find all 
	the relevant SLDs.<br>

	<ul style="border-width:3px; border-style:solid;border-color:#697698; padding: 1em; padding-left: 40px; background-color: #f9f9f9"> 
		<b>Task 1: Find SLDs</b>
		<li>Use your preferred tool to fill out the SLDs in the table below.</li>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td>Material</td>
				<td>Chemical formula</td>
				<td>Density (g/cm$^3$)</td>
				<td>Neutron SLD ($10^{-6} \text{ Å}^{-2}$)</td>

				<td>D$_2$O</td>
				<td>1.1</td>
				<td> </td>
				<td> </td>
			</tr>

		</table>
		
	</ul>

	Next we want to calculate the $\Delta \text{SLD}$ between all the different substances. We will put $\Delta \text{SLD}^2$ in the table.
	That means that the values above the diagonal should be the square of the neutron SLD, while the values below the diagonal should be the square of the X-ray SLDs. This is done, because the measure scattering in proportioanl to SLD squared (scattering cross section). <br><br>

		<li>Which features will you expect to see with X-rays?</li>
		<li>If you use normal/heavy water as your solvent, which features can you expect to see with neutrons?</li>
	</ul>


	Before we make a decision on what kind of experiment(s?) to perform, we should also consider incoherent scattering.
	Incoherent scattering contributes $|q|$-independent background to the scattering. This makes it difficult to see
	features in the data, especially at low $q$-values, where the signal is weaker. However, this is essentially only a problem for neutrons.
	Go back to the SLD calculator, and find the incoherent scattering cross section for H$_2$O and D$_2$O for neutrons. <br><br>

<h4>Challenges</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Challenge 1: You wish to investigate the structure of <a href="https://avantiresearch.com/product/850345" target="_blank">DMPC</a> vesicles in SAXS. To do this, calculates its (x-ray) SLD. The volumes of head group (C$_{10}$H$_{18}$NO$_8$P) and tail group can be found in <a href="TableS1.pdf" target="_blank">Table S1</a> of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b02704" target="_blank">Mortensen et al., 2018</a>.</li>
		<li>Challenge 2: In a next experiment, you wish to measure the time constant of lipid exchange in DMPC vesicles, using SANS. Therefore, you need to calculate neutron SLDs and its match point.</li>
		<li>Challenge 3: You wish to do further structural analysis with SANS, therefore: calculate the match point of, respectively, head and tail groups of DMPC. What structures would you expect to observe if you did those SANS experiments?</li>
	</ul>

<h4>Perspectives</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>SLD is a necessary first step needed before more complex modelling can be performed, such as those demonstrated in the <a href="../Lamellae/Lamellae.html" target="_blank">Vesicle tutorial</a>.</li>
		<li>Lipid exchange SANS experiments like those in challenge 2 have, e.g., been used to investigate lipid flipping rate and how these can be affected by peptides (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/4.0000045"  target="_blank">Nakao et al., 2021</a>).</li>
