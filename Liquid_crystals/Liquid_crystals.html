<em>Lipid molecules can adopt many liquid crystalline phases within biological settings (e.g., lamellar, hexagonal, and inverse hexagonal phases).</em>

</p>
<h4>Before you start</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Knowledge of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bragg%27s_law" target="_blank" >Bragg's law</a> and basic understanding of molecular self-assembly are assumed.
	</ul>
	
<h4>Learning outcomes</h4>
At the end of this tutorial you are expected to be able to: 
<ul>	
	<li>Identify some of the liquid crystalline structures within soft matter research.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Introductory remarks</h4>
	<p>
	Many biological amphiphilic molecules (a prominent example being lipids) can self-assemble into interesting geometries.
	In this tutorial, you are tasked to identify some of the major mesophases which lipids form.
	</p>

<h4>Part 1: Identifying a single phase system</h4>
	<p>
	
	Lipids are known to form liquid crystalline phases even in the food we consume (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/nn405123j" target="_blank">Salentinig et al., ACS Nano 2013</a>). 
	Small-angle scattering techniques provide insight into specific types of phases which lipids can form.

	</p>
	Scenario: you measured a mixture of lipids at a synchrotron SAXS. Work your way through to identify which phase(s) are present in your sample.
	In the figure below, you can immediately identify three diffraction peaks positioned at q = 0.064, 0.091, and 0.112 &Aring;<sup>-1</sup>.<br>
	
	<br>

	<p>

		<em>SAXS pattern of a lipid <a href="data/sampleA.txt" target="_blank">sample A</a>.</em>
	</p>
	You may also download and plot the <a href="data/sampleA.txt" target="_blank">data</a> and determine the peaks. A good idea is to plot with a linear scale for the $q$ axis, and zoom in on the peaks. 

	In the table below, you can find the respective peak positions of the diffraction peaks (i.e., first order, second order, ..., fifths order diffractions) which belong to different crystallographic phases.
	For more detailed explanation, we recommend Tyler et al., Methods in lipids, 199-225. The phases described in the table includes lamellar stacks (L<sub>&alpha;</sub>), 2-dimentional hexagonal phase (H<sub>2</sub> or p6mm), inverse bicontinuous hexagonal phase (Im3m), and a discontinuous cubic phase (Fd3m).<br>
		<p>

			<em>Table 1. Relative positions (on the q-axis) of Bragg peaks in four different lipid phases. </em>
		</p>
	The most obvious one you can test is the L<sub>&alpha;</sub> phase, as the diffraction peaks are separated by simple integer multiplication (i.e. the q position of the peaks are either 2 times, 3 times, 4 times, etc the q-value of the first-order diffraction peak). The liquid crystalline phase which adopts L<sub>&alpha;</sub> phase, thus, follows the scenario where the first diffraction position is at $q=0.064$ &Aring;<sup>-1</sup>, the second and third peaks should be at $q = 0.128$ and $q=0.192$ &Aring;<sup>-1</sup>, respectively.
	We can therefore exclude L<sub>&alpha;</sub> phase. A similar process can be followed by inserting the $q$-value of the first-order diffraction peak and calculate the expected positions of the subsequent diffraction peaks (see below).
	</p>

		<em>Table 2. Theoretical positions of Bragg peaks ($q$ values), relating to different phases, assuming first-order peak at $q=0.062$ &Aring;<sup>-1</sup>.</em>
	</p>
	Give a try at filling the table for the other phases. You should be able to find the Im3m phase to be the hit, where you have the match between the expected $q$-values and the actual positions of the diffraction peaks.<br>
	</p>


<h4>Challenges</h4>
In the challenges, you should identify unknown phase(s) from SAXS data (try solving the challenges without using the hints)<br><br>

<ul>
	<li>Challenge 1: Identify the phase(s) from the SAXS pattern below. Note that the first diffraction peak is positioned at 0.072 &Aring;<sup>-1</sup> (red arrow), which may happen, e.g., if the underlying form factor has a minimum at the same position.<br>

	</li>
	<li>Challenge 2: Identify the liquid phase(s) from the SAXS pattern below (<a href="hint1.html" target="_blank">first hint</a>, <a href="hint2.html" target="_blank">second hint</a>).<br> 
	<img src="Figure3.png" style="width:600px"/> <br>
	<em>SAXS pattern of a <a href="data/sampleC.txt" target="_blank">liquid crystal, sample C</a>.</em>
	</li>	
	</li>
	<li>Challenge 3: Identify the liquid phase(s) from <a href="data/SampleX.txt" target="_blank">sample X (you will need to plot the data yourself). </a> 
	</li>
</ul>
