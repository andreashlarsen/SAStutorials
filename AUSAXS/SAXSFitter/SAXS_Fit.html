</p>
<h4>Before you start</h4>
<ul>
	<li> Make sure you have the following free software installed: <br>
		(1) The <a href="https://github.com/AUSAXS/AUSAXS" target="_blank">AUSAXS</a> software.<br>
		(2) Python (including numpy, scipy, and matplotlib) to visualize the results.<br>
		(3) A qualitative understanding of SAXS data is advantageous, but not required. See, for example, <a href="../PrimaryDataAnalysis/PrimaryDataAnalysis.html" target="_blank"> Tutorial: Primary Data analysis.</a>
	</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning outcomes</h4>
In this tutorial you will learn how to use the structural validation program of the AUSAXS software to compare measured SAXS data with predictions from atomic-resolution structures.
<ul>
	<li>Be familiar with the AUSAXS software. </li>
	<li>Be able to perform structural validation based on measured SAXS data.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Introductory remarks</h4>
	<p> 
		While measured SAXS data by itself does not provide high-resolution information, when combined with atomic-resolution structures it can be a powerful tool for structural validation.
		Such validations have routinely been performed throughout the history of SAXS, for example by comparing measured data with predictions from crystal structures, NMR models, or, more recently, 
		AlphaFold models. <br><br>

		While we will in this tutorial use <code>AUSAXS</code> for the SAXS predictions, many other software packages, such as CRYSOL, Pepsi-SAXS, and FoXS offers the same functionality. 
		The primary difference in these softwares are the excluded volume models, which will not be discussed in detail here. 
		Be aware that none of these tools are suitable for wide-angle analyses. In such cases, molecular dynamics-based programs (such as WAXSiS) should be used. <br><br>

		For more information on the theory behind SAXS predictions from atomic-resolution structures, please refer to the references provided at the end of this tutorial.

<h4>Part I: Performing a basic validation</h4>


<h4>Part II: Analyzing the output</h4>

<h5>Part III: Using AUSAXS in Python scripts</h5>
We have recently released <code>pyAUSAXS</code>, a Python interface to the AUSAXS software. This allows you to easily integrate SAXS predictions into your own Python scripts.
We will in this section demonstrate how to use <code>pyAUSAXS</code> to perform the same analyses as in Part I & II. For more information, see the <a href="https://github.com/AUSAXS/pyAUSAXS" target="_blank">online documentation</a>.
