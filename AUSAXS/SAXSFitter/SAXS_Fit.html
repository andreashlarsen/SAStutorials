</p>
<h4>Before you start</h4>
<ul>
	<li> Make sure you have the following free software installed: <br>
		(1) The <a href="https://github.com/AUSAXS/AUSAXS" target="_blank">AUSAXS</a> software.<br>
		(2) Python (including numpy, scipy, and matplotlib) to visualize the results.<br>
		(3) A qualitative understanding of SAXS data is advantageous, but not required. See for example <a href="../PrimaryDataAnalysis/PrimaryDataAnalysis.html" target="_blank"> Tutorial: Primary Data analysis.</a>
	</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning outcomes</h4>
In this tutorial you will learn how to use the structural validation program of the AUSAXS software to compare SAXS data with atomic-resolution structures.
<ul>
	<li>Be familiar with the AUSAXS software. </li>
	<li>Be able to validate an electron microscopy map against SAXS data.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Introductory remarks</h4>
	<p> 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope" target="_blank">Electron microscopy</a> has in recent years become a popular and powerful technique for studying the structure of biological macromolecules.
		A primary issue with the technique is that it is not performed under native conditions, and the resulting maps may therefore not be representative of the solution structure.
		Many validation techniques have therefore been developed to assess the quality of the maps, typically by comparing bond angles, bond lengths, and other geometric properties 
		with known structures. AUSAXS is a new software package that can be validate the maps by comparing them against small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data. <br><br>

		In this tutorial, we will explain how to use AUSAXS to compare small-angle X-ray scattering data with EM data. 
		Note that these are very different techniques, with the former probing the electron density of the sample, and the latter probing the charge density. 
		We are therefore not expecting perfect quantitative agreement, but will rather focus on comparing the data qualitatively.

		For more information on how the comparison is practically performed, please refer to the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798324005497" target="_blank">AUSAXS paper</a>.
